### Course Description
This course covers various up-to-date research topics on embedded systems. <br/> 
It is intended primarily for advanced graduate students in the field of embedded systems. <br/>
Recent conference papers as well as journal papers are used in the course.

### Course Goal 
This course prepares graduate students for advanced research in flash-based storage systems/architecture areas. 
The core part of the course introduces key components of flash-based storage systems (such as SSDs) in a comprehensive fashion starting from NAND flash cells to flash translation layer to systems software.
Based on the basic understanding on flash-based storage systems, students are exposed to current research topics in flash-related areas by studying recent technical papers from top systems conferences. <br/> 

### Prerequisites 
* Undergraduate Operating Systems or equivalent 
* Undergraduate Computer Architecture or equivalent 


### Course Organization 
This course consists of two main parts:   
**Part 1: Lectures on Key Components of Flash-based Storage Systems**
Topics include:  
 - NAND Flash Basics
 - Flash Translation Layers
 - SSD Architecture
 - Flash-Aware Operating System Issues
 - Flash-Aware File System Issues
 - Host/Application Managed Flash Issues


**Part 2: Recent Topics in Flash-based Storage Systems**   
 - Students present recent flash-related papers from top systems conferences such as  
   FAST, ATC, EUROSYS, ISCA, MICRO and DAC.
